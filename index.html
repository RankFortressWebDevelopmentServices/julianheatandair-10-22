                    Change your Air Filters Regularly
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Regularly changing your air filters is key to maintaining low energy bills and comfortable home. Air filters capture dust and dirt before they can circulate through your home, preventing them from clogging up your HVAC system. If the filter becomes full of debris, the system has to work harder to push air through – leading to higher electricity costs. Additionally, a clogged filter can cause system breakdowns which are costly to repair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Filters should be replaced at least once a month, if not more often. If you have pets or someone in the house who is allergic to dust, change your air filters more often. Any hardware store or online will supply the correct size filter for your home. Just follow the instructions carefully to ensure that the filter is correctly installed. There are plenty of instructional videos on the internet if you’re unsure how to replace your air filter. It’s a simple process that only takes a few minutes and may help your HVAC system function smoothly all winter long.

                            Did you know that by making a few adjustments to your thermostat, you could be saving money on your energy bills? It’s true! Keep reading to discover how easy it is to get the most efficient use out of your HVAC. The key lies in understanding heating and cooling modes, and depending on the time of year, using one or the other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In heating mode, your thermostat activates your <a href="https://www.julianheatandair.com/heber-springs-air-conditioning/">air conditioner</a>; in cooling mode, it starts your furnace. The schedule setting on your thermostat determines when it will go from heating to cooling mode. You can either have it turned on and off at specific times of the day or keep it in one mode all the time. Because it affects how often your furnace or air conditioner operates, you may play a role in reducing energy use by adjusting the schedule setting.

                    Programmable Thermostats
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Although many are unaware, using a programmable thermostat is an easy way to conserve energy and cut costs on electricity bills for cooling and heating. By setting different temperatures at various times of the day, you can reduce wastefulness while still maintaining comfort. For example, when you’re away from home or asleep, set the temperature higher than usual so that your heater or AC doesn’t use as much power trying to cool or heat an unoccupied house. When creating a schedule with a programmable thermostat, keep the following things in mind:
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Make sure the thermostat is set to the proper temperature. Many people make the error of setting their thermostats for the incorrect season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Be sure to check the settings on your thermostat before you leave for the weekend. Some models have different settings for weekdays and weekends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    – Please remember that increasing the temperature will not make your home warm up faster. All it will do is add to your energy bill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Save money each month on your AC and heating bills by using a programmable thermostat.

                    Heating and Cooling Vents

                <p>
                    There are a few things you can do to make your <a href="https://www.julianheatandair.com/the-benefits-of-installing-a-new-air-conditioning-system/">HVAC system more energy-efficient</a>. The easiest thing you can do is ensure that your heating and cooling vents are properly aligned. If they’re not, you may be losing a lot of hot or cold air. Improving the efficiency of your system by ensuring there is enough insulation around your ductwork is also an option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you detect any duct leaks, seal them with duct tape or caulk. Finally, you may double-check that your heating and cooling system are sized appropriately for your home. If they’re too big or too little, they won’t function efficiently. Aside from these suggestions, you should have your HVAC system serviced on a regular basis to ensure that it is functioning properly.

                            One of the most essential appliances in your home is your HVAC system. It doesn’t only keep you warm or cool but also aids in circulating air throughout all living spaces. To ensure it’s running as efficiently as possible – saving you money – be sure to perform regular maintenance checks. This would entail inspecting the filters and making certain they aren’t blocked, assessing airflow and guaranteeing there isn’t a blockage, and cleaning coils if needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The right thermostat settings can also help you save money on your HVAC operating costs. For example, if your home is too hot in the summer, raising the temperature on your thermostat will keep it cooler without using as much power. Setting it colder during the winter will help you save money on your energy bill.

                    Get a maintenance checkup every year

                    When was the last time you had your HVAC maintenance done? If you can’t recall, it’s probably been a while since your last HVAC maintenance checkup. One of the greatest ways to optimize your HVAC system for maximum energy efficiency is to have it maintained on an annual basis. A technician will inspect your system for any issues and make any necessary repairs during a regular maintenance checkup. They’ll also clean out and tune up your equipment to assure that it’s working at top efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you don’t conduct regular maintenance checks, there are a few things you can do to help improve your system on your own. Make sure your filters are clean and in good working order. Dirty filters can reduce the effectiveness of your HVAC system by up to 20%. Keep the area around your HVAC unit clear as well. Ensure that there is at least two feet of clearance all around the unit for optimal air circulation.
